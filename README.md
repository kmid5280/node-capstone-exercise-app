## Summary

ExerciseLogger is an app that allows the user to keep track of daily workouts. Users can create an account and keep track of the kinds of exercise they are doing. They can specify the type of exercise they did, the amount of time they spend doing it, and add additional details as necessary.

## Technology
ExerciseLogger relies on Node.js and uses AJAX calls to send and receive data from the server. It uses JWTs for authentication and renders information on the page via jQuery.
